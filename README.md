## Description
I made this module because i am really lazy to run the commands all the time, over and over.
It's tedious for me (because i'm really lazy) to select a path, create a folder to contain the project, run all the time "npm init -y", install dependencies, create files, create the start script, etc... So i just made this for the sake of simplicity.
